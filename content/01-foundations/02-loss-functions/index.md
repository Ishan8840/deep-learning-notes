## Mean squared error

MSE averages squared prediction errors:
$$
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
$$
$n$ is the number of observations, $y_i$ is the target, and $\hat y_i$ is the prediction.

**Gradient**
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial \hat{y}_i} = -\frac{2}{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)$$
**Example**
actual values: [10, 20, 30, 40 , 50]
predicted values: [12, 18, 32, 38, 48]

squared differences: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
average of these: 4 = mse

gradient = [4, -4, 4, -4, -4] / 5

**Why**
- it penalizes large errors more heavily than small ones
- simple to differentiate

## Softmax
- logits are the raw unnormalized scores returned by the last layer of the neural network
- softmax takes those logits and transforms it into a probability vector, where each element is between (0, 1) and all the elements sum to 1
$$\text{softmax} = \frac{e^{a_i}}{\sum_{k=1}^N e^{a_k}}$$
## Cross-entropy
- used for training models in classification
$$\text{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^C (y_{i,j} \cdot \log(p_{i,j}))
$$
- N is number of samples
- C is number of classes
- $y_{i,j}$ is 1 if class j is correct for sample i, 0 otherwise
- $p_{i,j}$ is model-predicted probability of sample i being in class j
- when using one hot encodings it reduces to this
$$\text{CE} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \log(p_{i,\mathrm{correct}})$$
- log sum exp trick which prevents overflow which is when a number becomes too large for a computer to store numerically
$$
\log\left(\sum_i e^{x_i}\right)
=
m+\log\left(\sum_i e^{x_i-m}\right),
\qquad
m=\max_i(x_i)
$$
**Gradient**
$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial a_{i,j}} = \frac{p_{i,j}-y_{i,j}}{N}$$

## KL divergence

- A way to quantify the difference between two probability distributions
- Forward KL is mode covering, cover everything P cares about
- Reverse KL is mode seeking, stay inside good regions of P
$$D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P\|Q) = \sum_i P(i)\log \frac{P(i)}{Q(i)}$$
**Gaussian Distribution**
- A [VAE](../../02-generative-models/02-vae/index.md) has an encoder that maps an input $x$ to a distribution over latent variable $z$.
- A KL term can keep that distribution close to a chosen prior, giving the latent space structure useful for generation.
